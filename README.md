## Software

The following tools will be necessary or at least very useful for our tutorials, so please install them:

1. Python 3 through Anaconda
2. Popular Python packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, keras.
3. Visual studio code (IDE for editing and running your code)
4. Exploratory.io and/or Microsoft Power BI (software for exploratory data analysis)
